## Project Description

Trendify is a full-stack e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project demonstrates my proficiency in developing a secure, scalable, and user-friendly online shopping experience for trendy clothing items.

## Key Skills Highlighted

- **MERN Stack Expertise :** This project showcases my ability to effectively leverage the MERN stack for both front-end and back-end development.
- **Secure User Authentication :** Secure login and signup features with user data stored in MongoDB Atlas demonstrate my understanding of secure user management practices.
- **RESTful API Design :** Building robust back-end API endpoints using RESTful principles ensures efficient data exchange between the front-end and back-end.
- **Admin Page :** To handle the adding and removing the items from the website We can use this Admin Pannel.
- **Responsive Design :**  Implementing a responsive design ensures a seamless user experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), highlighting my knowledge of responsive web development techniques.
- **Front-End Development (React & CSS) :** Building the user interface with React and CSS showcases my front-end development skills.
- **Back-End Development (Node.js & Express) :** Developing the server-side logic with Node.js and Express demonstrates my back-end development capabilities.
- **Database Management (MongoDB Atlas) :** Utilizing MongoDB Atlas for data storage highlights my proficiency in NoSQL databases and cloud solutions.
- **Integration Techniques :** Seamless integration between front-end and back-end using CORS and potentially Multer for local image storage (if implemented) demonstrates my understanding of communication protocols and image handling techniques.

## Project Features

- Secure user authentication with user data stored in MongoDB Atlas.
- Category browsing (men's, women's, kids).
- Popular product and new collection listings.
- Detailed product view pages.
- Shopping cart functionality with user-specific management (adding, removing items).
- Responsive design.

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone and set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm (or yarn)** : nsure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn, a package manager) installed on your system. Download and install them from the official websites:
   - Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
   - npm (comes bundled with Node.js installation)
   - yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
2. **MongoDB Atlas Account :** Create a free account on MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) to set up your NoSQL database.

### Steps :

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Banda-Manjunatha/E_Commerce.git
    ```
    
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd E_Commerce
    ```

     - **For Frontend :**
         ```bash
         cd frontend
         ```
     - **For Backend :**
         ```bash
         cd backend
         ```
     - **For Admin Panel :**
         ```bash
         cd admin
         ```
      
3. **Install Dependencies :**

     ```bash
    npm install  # Assuming you're using npm for package management
    ```
     
  - This command installs all the necessary libraries and packages your project requires to function.
  - If you're using yarn for package management, the command would be `yarn install`.

4. **Configuration :**

  - Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (.env is a hidden file, use `touch .env` to create it). This file will store sensitive information like your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
  - Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string and any other environment variables your project needs to the `.env` file.
  - Important: Never commit the `.env` file to your Git repository as it contains sensitive information.

5. **Start the Development Server :**
  
  - **For Frontend :**
    
     ```bash
     npm start  # Assuming you're using npm for package management
    ```

  - **For Backend :**

    ```bash
     node server.js 
    ```

  - **For Admin Panel :**

    ```bash
     npm start  # Assuming you're using npm for package management
    ```
    
## Contribution
